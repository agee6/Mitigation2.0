        <p id="introText" class="modal-text">Welcome to Mitigation! This is a game like risk, but where battles are not based on
          the random roll of the dice, but rather on the stragey of how many men are put forward in a given battle.
          Game play goes similar to risk, except if you want to attack another country, when it is your turn you can declare a war.
          Upon declaration you insantly engage in the first battle. Each War lasts at least 3 turns and maximum 4.
          If the aggressing army wins three battles, they have won the war and occupy the country, taking any remaining men lef in the country.
          A battle happens when each side chooses the number of men they have on the country to go to "battle" whoever has more soldiers at
          the battle wins the battle. One half of the men who go to war are "killed" and the other half return to their country.
          both players may move men into and out of the country at the end of their respective turns.
          So let's get started!
